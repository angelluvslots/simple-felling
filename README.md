# ðŸŒ³ðŸª“ simple felling

simple felling is a vanilla-plus style datapack that adds tree felling. when you break a log while sneaking the logs above it will turn into falling blocks, taking inspiration from minecraft's already existing features and keeping in mind the "one block at a time" rule. it's tiring having all of the tree felling mods/datapacks being too overpowered and non-vanilla-like, so if you're looking for something a little different this pack is perfect for you :3
