# ðŸŒ³ðŸª“ simple felling

simple felling is a vanilla-plus style datapack that adds tree felling. when you break a log while sneaking the logs of the tree above it will all fall down by one block, taking inspiration from minecraft's already existing features and keeping in mind the "one block at a time" rule. it's tiring having all of the tree felling mods/datapacks being too overpowered and non-vanilla-like, so if you're looking for something a little different this pack is perfect for you :3
